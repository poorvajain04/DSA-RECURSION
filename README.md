# DSA-RECURSION
Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into subproblems of the same type. Application: Sorting Algo, Tree and Graph traversal, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, DP with memoization etc.
